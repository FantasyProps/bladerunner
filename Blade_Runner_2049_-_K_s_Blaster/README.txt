# Summary

This is a replica of K's blaster from the movie Blade Runner 2049. It's modeled using a video reference and no measurements. It's reasonably accurate and incredibly imprecise. 

# How I Designed This

Modeled using Tested's video of Adam Savage examining the new Blade Runner blasters:

Due to not having the real blaster on hand, I made the overall size the same as Deckard's original blaster (about 10 inches).

This model is by no means perfect, in fact it is likely that not a single piece of the model lines up exactly with the original, however overall it does serve as a convincing costume piece. 

There are many things that could be tweaked to be more accurate, I have included the original SolidWorks file if you wish to tweak those yourself.
